  <h2>Data Privacy in the US</h2>
  <p>Data privacy is the idea that one should be allowed to determine for
    oneself what personal information is shared, to whom it is shared with, and
    to what extent that information is shared. This consists of requiring those
    on the receiving end of data transactions to only use the data for its
    intended purpose.  The right to privacy is understood; no one wants a
    stranger to know their legal name, address, or their credit card number.
    When it comes to the selling of user data, though, this right is violated.
    Data privacy, just like the good old fashioned right to privacy, should be
    considered a human right.
</p>
  <p>In the United States, there have been many issues related to data privacy.
    One company, with many examples of these issues, is Facebook. An example of
    these issues is when "the personal information of over 533 million Facebook
    users from 106 countries, including over 32 million records on users in the
    US, 11 million on users in the UK, and 6 million on users in India" was
    published on a hacking forum, according to Business Insider. A CNN article
    on this data leak states that  "names, phone numbers, Facebook IDs,
    locations, account creation dates, birthdays, relationship statuses, bios
    and, in some cases, email addresses" were leaked. This is an obvious issue.
  </p>
  <p>Another issue is Facebook tracking data even if you don't have an account,
    or aren't logged in. According to Newsweek, this was confirmed on Monday,
    April 16, 2018, when the company was trying to "shake off the unprecedented
    controversy that arose following allegations that it facilitated a breach of
    user data linked to an estimated 87 million accounts". This data leak is
    separate from the one discussed earlier. In a blog post, David Baser,
    Facebook's product management director responded to the claim that Facebook
    tracks data of people who don't have an account, stating that Facebook is
    not the only company to do this. He mentioned Twitter, LinkedIn, Google,
    Amazon and Pinterest as examples. This does not make the issue with Facebook
    any smaller, only shows how widespread the issues with data privacy spread.
  </p>
  <p>According to the United States Federal Trade Commission, "Facebook
    repeatedly used deceptive disclosures and settings to undermine users’
    privacy preferences". The company had to pay a five billion dollar penalty.
    While it is good, this fine is currently one of a kind. It's obvious that
    people realize, due to the examples shown by Facebook, that data privacy
    laws in the US are an issue, so where is the legislation?</p>
  <p>In Europe on the other hand, there has been legislation to protect user
    data, specifically, the General Data Protection Regulation. According to
    Brink News, "The impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has
    been widespread. Europe’s new data protection laws have resulted in 281,000
    breaches and 55 million euros ($61 million) in fines to some of the world’s
    biggest tech companies over the mishandling of personal information.
    Furthermore, the legislation has drawn a line in the sand as to what
    companies can and cannot do when it comes to sensitive user data." While
    the GDPR isn't clear on everything, it is a large step above the current
    situation in the US, as there is no federal legislation on the topic.
  </p>
  <p>Yet the individual states don't have the legislation needed either.
    According to CIO Dive, in the year following the GDPR, there was an uptick
    in the number of GDPR-like bills being created in individual states, but
    "year two shows no indication regulations will be up and running".  Less
    than 20 states had legislation in the making, one being California, with
    the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), which has set a precedent
    for this kind of legislation in the states.
  </p>
  <p>The US needs stricter Data Privacy laws and needs to consider Data Privacy
    a Human Right. According to a study by KPMG, one of the largest professional
    service companies in the world, "89% of consumers say data privacy is a human
    right" and that nine in every ten Americans believes that data privacy is a
    human right. The people of the US believe that their data should be protected.
    We need to support bills inspired by the GDPR and the CCPA, such as the Alabama
    Consumer Privacy Act, and the Massachusetts Information Privacy Act, and we
    need to build a world where data privacy is valued by large companies just
    as much as it is valued by individuals.
